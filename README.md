# Rust-based Linter for JavaScript and TypeScript (WASM)

A fast, modular linter built in Rust with pluggable rules for JavaScript and TypeScript. This linter leverages the power of WebAssembly (WASM) for high-performance linting, making it accessible in Node.js environments.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Each linting rule is implemented as a pluggable module, allowing for easy extensibility.
- **Performance**: Built in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for fast execution in Node.js.
- **Customizable Rules**: Add or remove linting rules dynamically by implementing additional modules.
- **WASM for Node.js**: Compiled to WebAssembly for seamless integration with Node.js.
